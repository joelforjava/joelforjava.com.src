        Hi, I'm Joel. I've been a java developer since 2005, working for a couple of consulting firms that have given me the opportunities to work across
        several industries, including entertainment, government, and automotive. These days, I spend most of my time working in the Python world, but I work
        within the java ecosystem whenever I can. I prefer working with Spring, Hibernate, and the multitude of front end technologies, but I dabble in other areas
        as well, including Kafka and Elasticsearch.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started this site at the end of 2016 with the intent of documenting all the issues I encountered in my day to day work. I wrote it mostly for me
        but wanted to publish it so that it could potentially help others that came across the same issue.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course, I didn't start publishing anything until sometime in 2018, but I've done my best to document how I work with Java, Groovy, and the 
        Java ecosystem as a whole. I also started working with Groovy a lot in my side projects and wanted to document how I worked with it and Grails.
    </p>

    <p>
        As previously mentioned, I don't get to work with Java a lot lately. I'm in mostly a Python world. I'm hoping to find ways to take
        what I've learned with Python and apply it to Java, Groovy, etc. I can definitely see some of the inspiration for Groovy from my time with Python.
        Also, I don't get to work much with any side projects lately, but I'm hoping
        I can find the time. I feel like I've missed out on so much in the Java world, but we'll see how it goes. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I even hear there's a Java 9 out now!

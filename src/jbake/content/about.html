    I started this site at the end of 2016 with the intent of documenting all the issues I encountered in my day to day work. I wrote it mostly for me
    but wanted to publish it so that it could potentially help others that came across the same issue.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, I didn't start publishing anything until sometime in 2018, but I've done my best to document how I work with Java, Groovy, and the 
    Java ecosystem as a whole. I also started working with Groovy a lot in my side projects and wanted to document how I worked with it and Grails.
</p>

<p>
    However, with one notable exception, I don't get to work with Java a lot lately. I'm in mostly a Python world. I'm hoping to find ways to take
    what I've learned with Python and apply it to Java, Groovy, etc. Also, I don't get to work much with any side projects lately, but I'm hoping
    I can find the time. I feel like I've missed out on so much in the Java world, but we'll see how it goes.

    Also, if you haven't noticed, I'm not that great with 'about' pages. They're probably worse than having to fill out a profile for a dating site.
    But, if you've read this far, thanks for visiting!

        I started this site at the end of 2016 with the intent of documenting all the issues I encountered in my day to day work. I wrote it mostly for me
        but wanted to publish it so that it could potentially help others that came across the same issue.

        Of course, I didn't start publishing anything until sometime in 2018, but I've done my best to document how I work with Java, Groovy, and the 
        Java ecosystem as a whole. I also started working with Groovy a lot in my side projects and wanted to document how I worked with it and Grails.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, with one notable exception, I don't get to work with Java a lot lately. I'm in mostly a Python world. I'm hoping to find ways to take
        what I've learned with Python and apply it to Java, Groovy, etc. Also, I don't get to work much with any side projects lately, but I'm hoping
        I can find the time. I feel like I've missed out on so much in the Java world, but we'll see how it goes. 
    </p>

        Also, if you haven't noticed, I'm not that great with 'about' pages. But, if you've read this far, thanks for visiting!

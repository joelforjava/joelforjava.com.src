That's about the plainest way I can say it. If you feel yourself getting burned out, stop. Just stop. Between my job and my attempts at side projects, I ended up severely burned out. Honestly, I still don't feel like I've recovered, but I can't just stop working on the things I enjoy while my job has tried to move me away from Java.

So, I may still be gone a while longer, but I'm going to try and get back into the swing of things and hopefully I'll be posting again soon. Starting small and just moving from there.

Always take care of yourself.

I'm not quite sure how to feel about 2019 with regards to my career and the technology I've been able to work with. As you may have gathered from the title of this blog, I come from a, more or less, 100% Java development background. I'm used to working in an object oriented fashion and used to working in the context of a web backend, using technologies like Spring, Struts, Hibernate, and all the things that go into making good, or at least decent Java/JVM code, like Findbugs, Sonarqube, and Checkstyle. I also like working with front-end technologies, like Angular, Vue.js, and good old-fashioned JavaScript. 2019, for me, turned out to be a very different year technology-wise than I could have ever expected. This isn't intended to be a complaint, but rather just an observation on how things have diverged a bit for me.

The biggest change for me has been the fact that I've spent 90% of my time working with Python, which was something I had only looked at in passing over the years thanks to WebLogic's use of Jython. I've spent nearly a year with the langage now and I don't feel like I know it any better than I did when I started. I do, however, feel like I've forgotten most of my Java/Groovy/Scala/etc. and I'm not pleased about it. I need to find a way in 2020 to spend some time sharpening up these skills without totally burning myself out, which I did indeed do earlier this year, mostly due to being thrown head-first into a project with an almost impossible deadline, and I still haven't fully recovered from it. I currently don't know how to balance my work and my desire to keep my Java skills sharp, but I'm hoping to find a way beyond just working with Kafka Connectors.

One thing I really did like is that I was finally able to work with a cloud provider. Prior to this year, I had only briefly worked with some of the Azure APIs, but now I get to work with AWS on a daily basis.

With all that said, I'm much more content at this job than my previous one.

One thing is clear: I really miss Java development. My work with Kafka Connect earlier in the year was the only Java code I've touched in over a year now. I miss Spring, Hibernate, etc. I miss working with web applications. I miss my Grails work. I'm hoping to find a way to return to at least some of it over the next year.

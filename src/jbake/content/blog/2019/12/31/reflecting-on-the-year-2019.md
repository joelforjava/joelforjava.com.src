2019, for me, turned out to be a very different year technology-wise from what I would've expected this time last year. Prior to this year, I had never really worked with a cloud provider before and also had done very little Python work. I ended up getting thrown in the deep end working with Python and AWS as a whole. All of these new things at the beginning of the year severely burned me out when mixed with a non-moveable deadline that we were stuck with. I spent a lot of this year burned out, managing to get my work done and not much else. I think I've finally moved past it, but I'm treading lightly.

I'm much more content at this job than my previous one, though.

One thing is clear: I really miss Java development. My work with Kafka Connect earlier in the year was the only Java code I've touched in over a year now. I miss Spring, Hibernate, etc. I miss working with web applications.

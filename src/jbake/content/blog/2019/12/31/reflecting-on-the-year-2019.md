2019, for me, turned out to be a very different year technology-wise from what I would've expected this time last year. I ended up getting thrown in the deep end working with Python and AWS as a whole. Prior to this year, I had never really worked with a cloud provider before and also had done very little Python work. All of these new things at the beginning of the year severely burned me out when mixed with a non-moveable deadline that we were stuck with.

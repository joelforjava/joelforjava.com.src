&lt;&lt;&lt; TODO - COMPLETE JAVA_9_UPDATES BEFORE PUBLISHING!! &gt;&gt;&gt;

Some developers prefer to create their streams outside of the try. However, until Java 9 came along, you'd have to create a local variable to reference these previously created objects. Now, you can pass in the object directly into the try without the need to create a local variable.

For several years now, I have set out intending to start this blog all about Java and the surrounding ecosystem. I keep putting it off for one reason or another, ranging from feeling like I never enough time to fearing that I'm not good enough to keep up something like this.

So, here I am fully intending to give this all a try. Again. I have so many things I’d like to write about, which brings up the question of where I should start writing. I suppose the best place for me to start is the beginning. I have several articles I wrote for myself back when Java 7 came out. Of course, we are now up to Java <del datetime="2018-04-11T02:41:04+00:00">9</del> 10, so these articles aren't as relevant as they may have been when I originally wrote them. I think I will keep the originals more or less intact. They deal with migrating code written using Java 5 and making use of new Java 7 constructs. I will take those changes and update the code to make use of Java 8, wherever possible and keep going to 9 and above to help keep up with the times.

This code will also need a lot of work in regards to refactoring, which will all come after moving through the newer versions of Java.  I'll just go where the code takes me, I suppose.

I also like working with Groovy, Grails, Scala, and plenty of other languages and frameworks within the Java world and I hope to have some articles around my experiences with them and more.

Here’s to hoping I’ll keep things going this time around!

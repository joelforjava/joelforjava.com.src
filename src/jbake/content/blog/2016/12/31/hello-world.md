Hi everyone! My name is Joel and I have been a java developer for over 10 years now. Lately, I have become more and more interested with working with newer technologies and languages but find myself working on legacy software without a lot of chances to branch out into the expanded java world. Through this blog, I hope to explore newer technologies and help explain the baffling issues I come across along the way. I will also discuss the java language itself and explore topics that will hopefully be relevant to more than just myself.

I look forward to posting new topics and ideas!

Also, please excuse the mess as I continue configuring the site in a way I think looks best.
